Week 2 Task 3

Write the pseudocode corresponding to functions for addition, subtraction and
multiplication of two matrices, and then compute A=B*C â€“2*(B+C), where B and C
are two quadratic matrices of order n. What is the run-time?

Let's say that our Matrices are going to have 3 rows and 3 columns

GENERATE-MATRIX(n)
    matrix <- new Matrix()
    FOR all values in n
        matrix.push([0] * n)

    RETURN matrix

This helps us create an empty matrix
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]

ADDITION(A, B)
    length <- sizeof(A)
    Z <- GENERATE-MATRIX(length)
        for a in length
            for b in length
                Z[a][b] = A[a][b] + B[a][b]
        return Z

SUBTRACTION(A, B)
    length <- sizeof(A)
    Z <- GENERATE-MATRIX(length)
        for a in length
            for b in length
                Z[a][b] = A[a][b] - B[a][b]
        return Z

MULTIPLICATION(A, B)
    length <- sizeof(A)
    Z <- GENERATE-MATRIX(length)
    if B is an Integer
        for a in length
            for b in length
                Z[a][b] = A[a][b] * B
    else
        for a in length
            for b in length
                Z[a][b] = A[a][b] * B[a][b]
    return Z
